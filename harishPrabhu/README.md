Bit Work for frontend of Valonia community portal. 

##Problem Statement Part I - 

Create a Events Calendar widget in any javascript frontend framework (We would love it , if you could use AngularJS /EmberJs /BackboneJs ) that satisfies the following user requirements.


### Widget Requirements

   Overview : Events Calendar will feature all events Valonia is hosting/organizing. This will be a normal calendar showing events happening in an ascending date format. Only events are shown, not the whole calendar. Clicking on an event will either expand/popup with major details and a ‘register now’ button. 

   Purpose : This will be used to show users right on the home page, what all events Valonia is hosting. He/she can scroll down and see if there is something they can attend.

   UI : Visual presentation ideas can be taken from event-management ideas like bookyshow / explara.
   
   The pop-up/expansion with details should have : 

    	1. Event name 

		2. Host Institute name

		3. A brief paragraph about the event

		4. The event poster which will have pricing and other details. 

		5. Register button, which will take user to the event registration form ( explained in xyz feature ) 

		6. Percentage of seats still left ( not the actual count ) 

		7. Instructor details if needed ( event based feature )  
		
		8. Add filters - show top events, events in your city, people registered for the event, days to register 

## Technical Requirements
  
   1. Any Javascript Framework (AngularJS / EmberJs preferred)

   2.  You can use a temporary backend for serving data for the widget 
      		                		OR 
       You could store data in localstorage of the browser and serve from there

   3. CSS Frameworks : Foundation or Bootstrap

   4. Responsive design 

## Approach 

The Feature would be completed when Swapnil , reviews and accepts the same. 

Swapnil may go crazy on you, and ask you to make more changes. Please be patient. We are looking to build our team at Valonia , your commitment is more important than your skills.
