This will be a normal calendar showing events happening in an ascending date format. Only events are shown, not the whole calendar. Clicking on an event will either expand/popup with major details and a ‘register now’ button. \r\n\r\n   Purpose : This will be used to show users right on the home page, what all events Valonia is hosting. He/she can scroll down and see if there is something they can attend.\r\n\r\n   UI : Visual presentation ideas can be taken from event-management ideas like bookyshow / explara.\r\n   \r\n   The pop-up/expansion with details should have : \r\n\r\n    \t1. Event name \r\n\r\n\t\t2. Host Institute name\r\n\r\n\t\t3. A brief paragraph about the event\r\n\r\n\t\t4. The event poster which will have pricing and other details. \r\n\r\n\t\t5. Register button, which will take user to the event registration form ( explained in xyz feature ) \r\n\r\n\t\t6. Percentage of seats still left ( not the actual count ) \r\n\r\n\t\t7. Instructor details if needed ( event based feature )  \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t8. Add filters - show top events, events in your city, people registered for the event, days to register \r\n\r\n## Technical Requirements\r\n  \r\n   1. Any Javascript Framework (AngularJS / EmberJs preferred)\r\n\r\n   2.  You can use a temporary backend for serving data for the widget \r\n      \t\t                \t\tOR \r\n       You could store data in localstorage of the browser and serve from there\r\n\r\n   3. CSS Frameworks : Foundation or Bootstrap\r\n\r\n   4. Responsive design \r\n\r\n## Approach \r\n\r\nThe Feature would be completed when Swapnil , reviews and accepts the same. \r\n\r\nSwapnil may go crazy on you, and ask you to make more changes. Please be patient. We are looking to build our team at Valonia , your commitment is more important than your skills. \r\n\r\n##Submissions\r\n\r\n### If you know GIT and GITHUB?\r\nYou could create a fork of this repo. \r\nCommit your code & generate a pull request. \r\n\r\n### Use online services \r\n\r\nLike plnkr.co , jsFiddle , jsBin , codePen or any other such free service. \r\n\r\n### Compressed files (the old linux way)\r\n\r\nPlease write a mail explaining how to test the code with the compressed files attached at suhassrivastava@valonia.co.in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
